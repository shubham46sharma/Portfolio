## Experience

### Software Engineer at Palm Beach Accountable Care Organization
- Built a real-time HL7 file ETL pipeline in .NET, which sounds fancy but really just means I made sure doctors got their patient data on time.
- Migrated Angular from v5 to v16, because who doesn't love living on the bleeding edge of JavaScript fatigue?
- Streamlined authentication by migrating from Azure B2B to Azure B2C. Translation: made logging in slightly less painful for everyone involved.

### Software Engineer Intern at Informatica
- Conducted proof-of-concept testing, which is a fancy way of saying I broke things in creative ways.
- Built modularized and reusable components, making me the IKEA of the software world.

### Full Stack Intern at Span Design Organization
- Developed multiple projects, proving that I can, in fact, walk and chew gum at the same time.
- Enhanced UI/UX, because making things pretty is just as important as making them work.

## Projects

### 8 Puzzle Solver
Implemented algorithms that solve puzzles faster than you can say "algorithmic complexity."

### Professional Network
Developed a LinkedIn clone because who doesn't need another social network in their life?
